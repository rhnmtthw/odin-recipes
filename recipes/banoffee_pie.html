            <p>Banoffee pie is a rich and indulgent dessert made from layers of crushed biscuits, smooth caramel (toffee), sliced bananas, and whipped cream. 
            The name “banoffee” comes from combining “banana” and “toffee,” the two main flavors in the pie. It typically starts with a base made from crushed 
            graham crackers or digestive biscuits mixed with butter, creating a crunchy crust. This is topped with thick, gooey caramel—often made from condensed 
            milk—followed by fresh banana slices and a generous layer of light, fluffy whipped cream.</p>

            <p>This no-bake dessert is loved for its perfect balance of sweetness, creaminess, and texture. The combination of the soft bananas, rich caramel, and airy cream</p>

            <div class="content">
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the crust – Mix crushed graham crackers (or biscuits) with melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into a pie dish to form the crust. 
                Chill in the fridge for 10–15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Make the caramel – In a saucepan, boil the unopened can of condensed milk in water for 2–3 hours (make sure the can is fully submerged at all times).
                 Let it cool before opening. Or use ready-made dulce de leche for a faster option.</li>
                    <li>Assemble the pie – Spread the cooled caramel over the chilled crust. Layer the sliced bananas evenly on top of the caramel.</li>
                    <li>Add the whipped cream – Whip the heavy cream (add sugar if desired) until it forms soft peaks. Spread the whipped cream over the bananas.</li>
                    <li>Finish and chill – Sprinkle with grated chocolate or cocoa powder if you like. Chill the pie for at least 1 hour before serving.</li>
