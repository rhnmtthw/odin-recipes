        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of wide, flat pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, 
            and melted mozzarella. Each layer is carefully assembled and baked to perfection, creating a hearty and comforting meal. 
            The meat sauce, often made with ground beef or pork, is simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs to develop a deep, savory flavor. 
            The result is a dish that’s both satisfying and flavorful, perfect for gatherings or family dinners.</p>

        <p>Over the years, lasagna has evolved into various regional and international versions. Some recipes include vegetables like spinach, 
            zucchini, or mushrooms, while others use alternative proteins or cheeses. Vegetarian and even vegan lasagnas are popular too, 
            showcasing how versatile the dish can be. Despite its variations, the essence of lasagna remains the same—warm, layered goodness 
            that brings people together around the table. </p>
